  Computes the "softmax" function over an array.

  Based on code from https://github.com/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet/

  This is what softmax looks like in "pseudocode" (actually using Python
  and numpy):

      x -= np.max(x)
      exp_scores = np.exp(x)
      softmax = exp_scores / np.sum(exp_scores)

  First we shift the values of x so that the highest value in the array is 0.
  This ensures numerical stability with the exponents, so they don't blow up.
